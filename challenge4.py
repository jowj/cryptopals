# this leads me to believe that something in the first block is incorrect; unhexlify, or possible isprintable()
# i am leaning towards unhexlify
# its also possible that the strings are Just Weird On Purpose, and not intended to be english
# if that's the case i'm also screwed, because my weight system is based on the english language.

# turns out, .isprintable() removes newlines so WHOOPS.
# SHIT fuck it turns out MaxValue is being overwritten.
